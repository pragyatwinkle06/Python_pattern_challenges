''' Maximum sum bitonic subarray

Given an array containing n numbers. The problem is to find the maximum sum bitonic subarray. A bitonic subarray is a subarray in which elements are first increasing and then 
decreasing. A strictly increasing or strictly decreasing subarray is also considered a bitonic subarray. Time Complexity of O(n) is required.

Examples:

Input : arr[] = {5, 3, 9, 2, 7, 6, 4}
Output : 19
The subarray is {2, 7, 6, 4}.

Input : arr[] = {9, 12, 14, 8, 6, 5, 10, 20}
Output : 54
